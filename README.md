# ðŸŽ² Saikoro
**Saikoro** is a library for evaluating dice rolls with a syntax similar to [Dice Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation). 
Expressions are treated as mathemical expressions where the `D` or `d` operator is used for rolling dice, and is a high-priority operator. It also comes with a very (painfully) simple command-line executable implementation.

# Code Example
A very basic usage of Saikoro's library would look something like
```rust
fn main() {
    if let Ok(roll) = saikoro::evaluate("8d6") {
        println!("Fireball deals {} fire damage", roll.value),
    }
}
```

# Currently Implemented Features
- Dice operator for rolling (`D`/`d`)
- Common mathematical operators
  - Addition & Subtraction (`+` & `-`)
  - Multiplication & Division (`*` & `/`)
  - Modulo (`%`)
  - Exponentiation (`^`)
- Filtering comparison operators to conditionally remove dice rolls (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)
- Individual roll operations returned and able to be individually used, not just final totals

# Syntax Documentation
## Binary Operator Priority
Elements higher in the list are evaluated before those lower in the list
 1. Dice `D`/`d`
 2. Comparison `==` `!=` `<` `>` `<=` `>=`
 3. Exponentiation `^`
 4. Multiplicative `*` `/` `%`
 5. Additive `+` `-`

Unary `+` and `-` are implemented, as well as a unary `D`/`d` operator 

Unary `+` is practically a no-op and has *lower* priority than comparison operators

Unary `D`/`d` works the same as a binary `D`/`d` with `1` on the left-hand side (i.e. `d20` is equivalent to `1d20`)

## Comparison Operators Note
Comparison operators will remove elements in the left-hand roll item where the value does not meet the filter critera implied by the operator.  
For example: `5d8 > 5` will cause the `5d8` result to only count rolls with a value greater than 5
(eg. if `5d8` would produce `{1, 3, 4, 5, 8}`), the final total will be `13`, as the `1` `3` and `4` will be filtered out)

If the left-hand side is found to not be a roll result at **evaluation-time**, then the `evaluate` function will return a error variant

For example:
```rust
// this will produce an error variant, as the left-hand side is a constant 6
let result = saikoro::evaluate("6 > 3");
assert!(result.is_err());

// this will also produce an error variant, as when the 2d6 + 5 is evaluated, only a number representing the total is left
// there are currently to plans allow for this sort of construction, but none are yet implemented
let maybe_unintuitive = saikoro::evaluate("(2d6 + 5) > 9");
assert!(maybe_unintuitive.is_err());
```

# Planned Features
- Common mathematical function (eg. `abs`, `sin`, `max`, `log`)
- Support for custom function definitions for parser to use
- Filter operator aplicability check at parse-time
- Macro for buidling fixed expressions at compile-time
- A means of applying operators to dice rolls element-wise instead of on simple total (syntax undecided)
